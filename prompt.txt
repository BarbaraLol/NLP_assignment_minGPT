These models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in text generation, understanding, and reasoning tasks. However, interpreting their internal mechanisms remains a significant challenge. The study of mechanistic interpretability aims to uncover how these models process and transform inputs at each layer to generate coherent outputs. This report investigates the interpretability of GPT models, with a focus on activation patchingâ€”a method to analyze how specific activations influence model outputs. Using examples in multiple languages and mixed contexts, we evaluate the model's ability to process, translate, and integrate multilingual data. Furthermore, we visualize the impact of activation patching using heatmaps to identify key layers and tokens responsible for specific outputs. The goal of this report is to provide a detailed analysis of the model's interpretability, highlighting its multilingual capabilities and limitations. Through structured experiments, we aim to deepen our understanding of how transformer-based models achieve language comprehension across diverse inputs. \section{Limitations and challenges} \section{Conclutions} \end{document}  This is a project of implementation and testing of miniGPT, but the only code I wrote is in generate_en.py, generate_es.py, generate_it.py, generate_fr.py and the sbatch file. I should write a report about it, but just the first part of it, in where I am explaining how the code I implemented works, how miniGPT works... Can you help me write my part? Do it in Latex
